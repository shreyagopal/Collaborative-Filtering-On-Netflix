# Collaborative-Filtering-On-Netflix

In the present world, before investing on any product, users are looking for the reputation or rating of the product in the internet. Product companies are using this pattern to their advantage by giving recommendations to users when they shop for a product int heir platform. In a way this recommendation systems are useful to users also. This method will give users the list of products or items of their interest based on their past history.

As an example, let us look at the task of movie recommendation. Suppose we have 1,000,000 users, and a list of the movies each user has watched (from a catalog of 500,000 movies). Our goal is to recommend movies to users. To solve this problem some method is needed to determine which movies are similar to each other. Here comes the concept of recommendation systems. The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system technique called collaborative filtering on Netflix data issued for the NETFLIX Prize.
